When the emailSettings information is used for an envelope, it only applies to that envelope.   **IMPORTANT**: The emailSettings information is not returned in the GET for envelope status. Use GET /email_settings to return information about the emailSettings.   EmailSettings consists of:   * replyEmailAddressOverride - The Reply To email used for the envelope.
